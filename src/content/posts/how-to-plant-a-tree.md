Master the art of proper tree planting with expert techniques from Orange County's premier horticulturist.

## Quick Reference Guide

### Ideal Conditions

- Hole width: 2x root ball diameter
- Depth: Equal to root ball height
- Soil mixture: 60% native, 40% compost
- Season: Fall or early spring preferred

### Essential Tools

- Shovel and spading fork
- Garden pruners
- Measuring tape
- Water source and hose
- Wheelbarrow for soil mixing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

The most common mistake when planting a tree is digging a hole that's both too deep and too narrow. This can lead to several problems:

- Tree sinking into softer soil below
- Root ball crown rotting from excessive depth
- Insufficient oxygen access for proper root growth
- Limited root expansion due to narrow planting space

## Proper Planting Depth

Trees should never be transplanted deeper than their original growing depth. The hole width should be at least twice the diameter of the root ball or container. For bare root trees, consider the spread of the roots when determining width.

## Working with Clay Soil

### Avoiding Soil Glazing

When working with poorly drained clay soil, avoid glazing - a smooth barrier that impedes water movement. To prevent this:

- Use a fork to break up the bottom of the hole
- Drag fork points along the sides
- Create a slightly raised center bottom
- This promotes water dispersion and prevents pooling

## Seasonal Planting Guide

### Fall Planting (Recommended)

- Less water stress
- Optimal root development
- Better establishment before summer
- Reduced transplant shock

### Spring Planting

- Good for bare root trees
- Requires more attention to watering
- Monitor for heat stress
- Plan for summer care

## Container Tree Planting Tips

Container trees require special attention during planting:

- Remove plastic or metal containers completely
- Tear away sides of fiber containers
- Check for and address root binding
- Gently tease apart compressed roots
- Consider "butterflying" woody compacted roots

## Soil Preparation and Backfilling

Follow these steps for optimal results:

1. Break up soil outside the planting zone
2. Mix original soil with quality compost (40% compost to 60% original soil)
3. Backfill to container soil level
4. Compress gently by hand, not foot
5. Water deeply

## Post-Planting Care

### Watering Schedule

- **Week 1-2:** Daily watering
- **Week 3-12:** Every 2-3 days
- **Months 4-12:** Weekly
- Adjust based on weather and soil moisture

### Maintenance Tips

- Apply 2-3 inches of mulch
- Keep mulch away from trunk
- Monitor for pest issues
- Prune only dead/damaged branches

## Fertilization Guidelines

For optimal results, we recommend using Gro Power fertilizer. This specially formulated product provides the essential nutrients your newly planted tree needs for healthy establishment and growth.

- Wait 6-8 weeks after planting before first fertilization
- Apply fertilizer to the drip line, not near the trunk
- Water thoroughly after fertilizing
- Follow package instructions for application rates
- Fertilize in early spring and late fall

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Symptoms & Solutions

- **Yellowing leaves:** Check drainage and fertilization
- **Wilting:** Assess water needs and soil moisture
- **Leaf scorch:** Provide afternoon shade if needed
- **Slow growth:** Evaluate soil composition and nutrients

### Prevention Tips

- Monitor soil moisture regularly
- Maintain proper mulch depth
- Protect trunk from damage
- Schedule regular inspections

## Expert Tip

Remember that proper planting is crucial for long-term tree health. Take your time with each step, especially root preparation and soil composition. A well-planted tree will reward you with decades of beauty and growth.
