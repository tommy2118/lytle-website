Master the fundamentals of landscape design with expert insights from Orange County's premier horticulturist.

## Key Design Principles

### Foundation Elements
- Color harmony
- Balance and proportion
- Form and function
- Repetition and contrast

### Design Considerations
- Purpose and functionality
- Style selection
- Long-term growth planning
- Maintenance requirements

## Understanding Purpose and Function

Before putting anything on paper or in the ground, it's crucial to understand your garden's purpose. Your outdoor space might serve as:

- A viewed work of art
- An extended living space
- An entertainment area
- A children's play area
- A quiet retreat for relaxation

### Choosing Your Style

While there are various design styles to choose from (Italian, tropical, southwest, native), the best results often come from thoughtfully blending different styles to create a unique look that suits Orange County landscapes.

## Layout and Planning

### Hardscape First
- Begin with patios and walkways
- Define raised planters
- Plan ground-level planting areas
- Consider lawn space requirements

### Plant Selection
- Privacy screening considerations
- Shade requirements
- Specimen tree placement
- Wall-softening vines

## Long-Term Growth Considerations

One of the most common mistakes in landscape design is failing to account for long-term growth. In Orange County's typically small landscapes, using dwarf varieties whenever possible allows plants to reach their full beauty without outgrowing their space.

## Plant Placement Strategies

- Group plants in threes or more
- Repeat groupings throughout the landscape
- Consider leaf shape and color contrast
- Balance "grassy" plants with broad-leaf varieties

## Expert Tip

While these basics provide a foundation for landscape design, working with an experienced designer can help you avoid costly mistakes and create a truly exceptional outdoor space that might not have occurred to you otherwise.
